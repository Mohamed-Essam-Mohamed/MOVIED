#MOVIES APP

## 🚀 Getting Started

- The application is fully API-dependent.
- pagination shows the pages.
- used searchDelegate to search.
-  As we know, to get news from the internet we should connect to an API so let’s see the News API that we will use in this app.
-  News API is a simple JSON-based REST API for searching and retrieving news articles and articles from specific sources from all over the internet. Using this, one can fetch the most important news articles that work on a news site or search for the most important news on a specific topic (or keyword).
-   News can be retrieved based on some criteria. Say the topic (keyword) to be searched is 'route' or may be related to a particular channel
-   used package   webview_flutter: ^4.7.0 To get the source of the news and display it in the application.
-   News app built using news API, the user can display news agencies according to the categories, he can search for a piece of the article
using different endpoints and he can view the website of the article, the app also utilizes pagination for lazily loading data.
